# relaxed_NGS_data_processing
This bash-script (with relaxed processing of NGS data by simple programs) was made up for russian speaking people that new with NGS.

Sorry, but i have writen its for russian speaking and don't want to translate on Eng. The code is simple - all is clear.
If somebody interest in the script (i have no idea why it can be),
i will answer to all questions immediately - danatyermakovich@gmail.com
And maybe i might put some English explanation inside the script.
